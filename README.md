##### Phantom Token Flow

###### Overview

Phantom Token Flow is a Python-based educational project designed to demonstrate the Phantom Token approach, a security pattern commonly used in API authentication and authorization, particularly in OAuth 2.0 contexts. The project simulates the interaction between a client, a resource server, and an authorization server to showcase how phantom tokens can be used to securely manage API access.

###### Components

Authorization Server: Simulates the issuance and validation of JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and handles the exchange of phantom tokens for real tokens.
Resource Server: Validates incoming phantom tokens with the authorization server and processes requests upon successful validation.
Client: Sends requests to the resource server, including phantom tokens for authentication.

###### Key Features

Simplified Demonstration: Offers a straightforward and simplified demonstration of the Phantom Token approach, making it easier for learners to grasp the concept.
Real JWT Implementation: Utilizes PyJWT for generating and handling JWTs, providing a real-world example of token handling.
Flask-based Servers: Uses the Flask framework for setting up lightweight and easy-to-understand servers.

###### Purpose

The primary goal of Phantom Token Flow is education. It provides a hands-on experience for understanding how phantom tokens work in the context of API security. By exploring this project, users can learn about token-based authentication, secure communication between different server components, and the basics of JWT.

###### How to Use

Install the required Python packages: Flask and PyJWT.
Run the authorization server, resource server, and client scripts separately.
Observe the flow of requests and token exchanges between the client, resource server, and authorization server.

###### Note

This project is intended for educational purposes and should not be used as a production-level solution for API security. Real-world implementations would require additional security measures, error handling, and robust validation mechanisms.
